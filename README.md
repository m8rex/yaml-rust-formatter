`yaml-rust-formatter` is a configurable formatter for YAML.

## Quick Start

## Goals

- Formatting YAML files without being opiniated.
- A configuration file specifies how to format the YAML.

## Minimum Rust version policy

This crate's minimum supported `rustc` version is 1.31 (released with Rust 2018, after v0.4.3), as this is the currently known minimum version for [`regex`](https://crates.io/crates/regex#minimum-rust-version-policy) as well.
